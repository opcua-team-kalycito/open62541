=head1 NAME

userThreadJitterStatistics - Plugin to monitor user thread start time jitter

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This is a wildcard plugin. To monitor user thread start time jitter, link
userThreadJitterStatistics file in /etc/munin/plugins/ folder to this file. E.g.

  ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/userThreadJitterStatistics \
        /etc/munin/plugins/userThreadJitterStatistics



=head1 NOTES

If run with the "autoconf"-parameter, give our opinion on whether we
should be run on this system or not. This is optional, and only used
by munin-config. In the case of this plugin, we should most probably
always be included.
